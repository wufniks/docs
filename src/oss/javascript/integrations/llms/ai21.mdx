You can get started with AI21Labs' Jurassic family of models, as well as see a full list of available foundational models, by signing up for an API key [on their website](https://www.ai21.com/).

Here's an example of initializing an instance in LangChain.js:

import IntegrationInstallTooltip from '/snippets/javascript-integrations/integration-install-tooltip.mdx';

<IntegrationInstallTooltip/>

```bash npm
npm install @langchain/community @langchain/core
```

import Ai21 from "/snippets/javascript-integrations/examples/models/llm/ai21.mdx";

<Ai21 />
