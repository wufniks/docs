> [Friendli](https://friendli.ai/) enhances AI application performance and optimizes cost savings with scalable, efficient deployment options, tailored for high-demand AI workloads.

This tutorial guides you through integrating `ChatFriendli` for chat applications using LangChain. `ChatFriendli` offers a flexible approach to generating conversational AI responses, supporting both synchronous and asynchronous calls.

## Setup

Ensure the `@langchain/community` is installed.

import IntegrationInstallTooltip from '/snippets/javascript-integrations/integration-install-tooltip.mdx';

<IntegrationInstallTooltip/>

```bash npm
npm install @langchain/community @langchain/core
```

Sign in to [Friendli Suite](https://suite.friendli.ai/) to create a Personal Access Token, and set it as the `FRIENDLI_TOKEN` environment.
You can set team id as `FRIENDLI_TEAM` environment.

You can initialize a Friendli chat model with selecting the model you want to use. The default model is `meta-llama-3-8b-instruct`. You can check the available models at [docs.friendli.ai](https://docs.friendli.ai/guides/serverless_endpoints/pricing#text-generation-models).

## Usage

import Friendli from "/snippets/javascript-integrations/examples/models/chat/friendli.mdx";
