title: Ollama Functions
---

<Warning>
**The LangChain Ollama integration package has official support for tool calling. [Click here to view the documentation](/oss/integrations/chat/ollama#tools).**


</Warning>

LangChain offers an experimental wrapper around open source models run locally via [Ollama](https://github.com/jmorganca/ollama)
that gives it the same API as OpenAI Functions.

Note that more powerful and capable models will perform better with complex schema and/or multiple functions. The examples below
use [Mistral](https://ollama.ai/library/mistral).

<Warning>
**This is an experimental wrapper that attempts to bolt-on tool calling support to models that do not natively support it. Use with caution.**


</Warning>

## Setup

Follow [these instructions](https://github.com/jmorganca/ollama) to set up and run a local Ollama instance.

## Initialize model

You can initialize this wrapper the same way you'd initialize a standard `ChatOllama` instance:

```typescript
import { OllamaFunctions } from "@langchain/community/experimental/chat_models/ollama_functions";

const model = new OllamaFunctions({
  temperature: 0.1,
  model: "mistral",
});
```

## Passing in functions

You can now pass in functions the same way as OpenAI:

import FunctionCalling from "/snippets/javascript-integrations/examples/models/chat/ollama_functions/function_calling.mdx";

<FunctionCalling />

## Using for extraction

import Extraction from "/snippets/javascript-integrations/examples/models/chat/ollama_functions/extraction.mdx";

<Extraction />

<Tip>
You can see a simple LangSmith trace of this [here](https://smith.langchain.com/public/74692bfc-0224-4221-b187-ddbf20d7ecc0/r)
</Tip>

## Customization

Behind the scenes, this uses Ollama's JSON mode to constrain output to JSON, then passes tools schemas as JSON schema into the prompt.

Because different models have different strengths, it may be helpful to pass in your own system prompt. Here's an example:

import CustomPrompt from "/snippets/javascript-integrations/examples/models/chat/ollama_functions/custom_prompt.mdx";

<CustomPrompt />
