title: Fake LLM
---

LangChain provides a fake LLM chat model for testing purposes. This allows you to mock out calls to the LLM and and simulate what would happen if the LLM responded in a certain way.

## Usage

import IntegrationFake from "/snippets/javascript-integrations/examples/models/chat/integration_fake.mdx";

<IntegrationFake />
