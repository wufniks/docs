> and provides a cloud-native, fully managed vector retrieval service with horizontal expansion capabilities.
> `DashVector` exposes its powerful vector management, vector query and other diversified capabilities through a simple and
> easy-to-use SDK/API interface, which can be quickly integrated by upper-layer AI applications, thereby providing services
> including large model ecology, multi-modal AI search, molecular structure A variety of application scenarios, including analysis,
> provide the required efficient vector retrieval capabilities.

In this notebook, we'll demo the `SelfQueryRetriever` with a `DashVector` vector store.

## Create DashVector vectorstore

First we'll want to create a `DashVector` VectorStore and seed it with some data. We've created a small demo set of documents that contain summaries of movies.

To use DashVector, you have to have `dashvector` package installed, and you must have an API key and an Environment. Here are the [installation instructions](https://help.aliyun.com/document_detail/2510223.html).

NOTE: The self-query retriever requires you to have `lark` package installed.

```python
%pip install -qU  lark dashvector
```

```python
import os

import dashvector

client = dashvector.Client(api_key=os.environ["DASHVECTOR_API_KEY"])
```

```python
from langchain_community.embeddings import DashScopeEmbeddings
from langchain_community.vectorstores import DashVector
from langchain_core.documents import Document

embeddings = DashScopeEmbeddings()

# create DashVector collection
client.create("langchain-self-retriever-demo", dimension=1536)
```

```python
docs = [
    Document(
        page_content="A bunch of scientists bring back dinosaurs and mayhem breaks loose",
        metadata={"year": 1993, "rating": 7.7, "genre": "action"},
    ),
    Document(
        page_content="Leo DiCaprio gets lost in a dream within a dream within a dream within a ...",
        metadata={"year": 2010, "director": "Christopher Nolan", "rating": 8.2},
    ),
    Document(
        page_content="A psychologist / detective gets lost in a series of dreams within dreams within dreams and Inception reused the idea",
        metadata={"year": 2006, "director": "Satoshi Kon", "rating": 8.6},
    ),
    Document(
        page_content="A bunch of normal-sized women are supremely wholesome and some men pine after them",
        metadata={"year": 2019, "director": "Greta Gerwig", "rating": 8.3},
    ),
    Document(
        page_content="Toys come alive and have a blast doing so",
        metadata={"year": 1995, "genre": "animated"},
    ),
    Document(
        page_content="Three men walk into the Zone, three men walk out of the Zone",
        metadata={
            "year": 1979,
            "director": "Andrei Tarkovsky",
            "genre": "science fiction",
            "rating": 9.9,
        },
    ),
]
vectorstore = DashVector.from_documents(
    docs, embeddings, collection_name="langchain-self-retriever-demo"
)
```

## Create your self-querying retriever

Now we can instantiate our retriever. To do this we'll need to provide some information upfront about the metadata fields that our documents support and a short description of the document contents.

```python
from langchain.chains.query_constructor.schema import AttributeInfo
from langchain.retrievers.self_query.base import SelfQueryRetriever
from langchain_community.llms import Tongyi

metadata_field_info = [
    AttributeInfo(
        name="genre",
        description="The genre of the movie",
        type="string or list[string]",
    ),
    AttributeInfo(
        name="year",
        description="The year the movie was released",
        type="integer",
    ),
    AttributeInfo(
        name="director",
        description="The name of the movie director",
        type="string",
    ),
    AttributeInfo(
        name="rating", description="A 1-10 rating for the movie", type="float"
    ),
]
document_content_description = "Brief summary of a movie"
llm = Tongyi(temperature=0)
retriever = SelfQueryRetriever.from_llm(
    llm, vectorstore, document_content_description, metadata_field_info, verbose=True
)
```

## Testing it out

And now we can try actually using our retriever!

```python
# This example only specifies a relevant query
retriever.invoke("What are some movies about dinosaurs")
```

```output
query='dinosaurs' filter=None limit=None
```

```output
[Document(page_content='A bunch of scientists bring back dinosaurs and mayhem breaks loose', metadata={'year': 1993, 'rating': 7.699999809265137, 'genre': 'action'}),
 Document(page_content='Toys come alive and have a blast doing so', metadata={'year': 1995, 'genre': 'animated'}),
 Document(page_content='Leo DiCaprio gets lost in a dream within a dream within a dream within a ...', metadata={'year': 2010, 'director': 'Christopher Nolan', 'rating': 8.199999809265137}),
 Document(page_content='A psychologist / detective gets lost in a series of dreams within dreams within dreams and Inception reused the idea', metadata={'year': 2006, 'director': 'Satoshi Kon', 'rating': 8.600000381469727})]
```

```python
# This example only specifies a filter
retriever.invoke("I want to watch a movie rated higher than 8.5")
```

```output
query=' ' filter=Comparison(comparator=<Comparator.GTE: 'gte'>, attribute='rating', value=8.5) limit=None
```

```output
[Document(page_content='Three men walk into the Zone, three men walk out of the Zone', metadata={'year': 1979, 'director': 'Andrei Tarkovsky', 'rating': 9.899999618530273, 'genre': 'science fiction'}),
 Document(page_content='A psychologist / detective gets lost in a series of dreams within dreams within dreams and Inception reused the idea', metadata={'year': 2006, 'director': 'Satoshi Kon', 'rating': 8.600000381469727})]
```

```python
# This example specifies a query and a filter
retriever.invoke("Has Greta Gerwig directed any movies about women")
```

```output
query='Greta Gerwig' filter=Comparison(comparator=<Comparator.EQ: 'eq'>, attribute='director', value='Greta Gerwig') limit=None
```

```output
[Document(page_content='A bunch of normal-sized women are supremely wholesome and some men pine after them', metadata={'year': 2019, 'director': 'Greta Gerwig', 'rating': 8.300000190734863})]
```

```python
# This example specifies a composite filter
retriever.invoke("What's a highly rated (above 8.5) science fiction film?")
```

```output
query='science fiction' filter=Operation(operator=<Operator.AND: 'and'>, arguments=[Comparison(comparator=<Comparator.EQ: 'eq'>, attribute='genre', value='science fiction'), Comparison(comparator=<Comparator.GT: 'gt'>, attribute='rating', value=8.5)]) limit=None
```

```output
[Document(page_content='Three men walk into the Zone, three men walk out of the Zone', metadata={'year': 1979, 'director': 'Andrei Tarkovsky', 'rating': 9.899999618530273, 'genre': 'science fiction'})]
```

## Filter k

We can also use the self query retriever to specify `k`: the number of documents to fetch.

We can do this by passing `enable_limit=True` to the constructor.

```python
retriever = SelfQueryRetriever.from_llm(
    llm,
    vectorstore,
    document_content_description,
    metadata_field_info,
    enable_limit=True,
    verbose=True,
)
```

```python
# This example only specifies a relevant query
retriever.invoke("what are two movies about dinosaurs")
```

```output
query='dinosaurs' filter=None limit=2
```

```output
[Document(page_content='A bunch of scientists bring back dinosaurs and mayhem breaks loose', metadata={'year': 1993, 'rating': 7.699999809265137, 'genre': 'action'}),
 Document(page_content='Toys come alive and have a blast doing so', metadata={'year': 1995, 'genre': 'animated'})]
```

```python

```
