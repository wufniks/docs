[Aerospike Vector Search](https://aerospike.com/docs/vector) (AVS) is an
extension to the Aerospike Database that enables searches across very large
datasets stored in Aerospike. This new service lives outside of Aerospike and
builds an index to perform those searches.

This notebook showcases the functionality of the [LangChain Aerospike VectorStore
integration](https://github.com/aerospike/langchain-aerospike).

## Install AVS

Before using this notebook, we need to have a running AVS instance. Use one of
the [available installation methods](https://aerospike.com/docs/vector/install). 

When finished, store your AVS instance's IP address and port to use later
in this demo:


```python
AVS_HOST = "<avs_ip>"
AVS_PORT = 5000
```

## Install Dependencies 
The `sentence-transformers` dependency is large. This step could take several minutes to complete.


```python
!pip install --upgrade --quiet aerospike-vector-search==4.2.0 langchain-aerospike langchain-community sentence-transformers langchain
```
```output
[notice] A new release of pip is available: 25.0.1 -> 25.1.1
[notice] To update, run: pip install --upgrade pip
```
## Download Quotes Dataset

We will download a dataset of approximately 100,000 quotes and use a subset of those quotes for semantic search.


```python
!wget https://github.com/aerospike/aerospike-vector-search-examples/raw/7dfab0fccca0852a511c6803aba46578729694b5/quote-semantic-search/container-volumes/quote-search/data/quotes.csv.tgz

## Load the Quotes Into Documents

We will load our quotes dataset using the `CSVLoader` document loader. In this case, `lazy_load` returns an iterator to ingest our quotes more efficiently. In this example, we only load 5,000 quotes.


```python
import itertools
import os
import tarfile

from langchain_community.document_loaders.csv_loader import CSVLoader

filename = "./quotes.csv"

if not os.path.exists(filename) and os.path.exists(filename + ".tgz"):
    # Untar the file
    with tarfile.open(filename + ".tgz", "r:gz") as tar:
        tar.extractall(path=os.path.dirname(filename))

NUM_QUOTES = 5000
documents = CSVLoader(filename, metadata_columns=["author", "category"]).lazy_load()
documents = list(
    itertools.islice(documents, NUM_QUOTES)
)  # Allows us to slice an iterator
```


```python
print(documents[0])
```
```output
page_content='quote: I'm selfish, impatient and a little insecure. I make mistakes, I am out of control and at times hard to handle. But if you can't handle me at my worst, then you sure as hell don't deserve me at my best.' metadata={'source': './quotes.csv', 'row': 0, 'author': 'Marilyn Monroe', 'category': 'attributed-no-source, best, life, love, mistakes, out-of-control, truth, worst'}
```
## Create your Embedder

In this step, we use HuggingFaceEmbeddings and the "all-MiniLM-L6-v2" sentence transformer model to embed our documents so we can perform a vector search.


```python
from aerospike_vector_search.types import VectorDistanceMetric
from langchain_community.embeddings import HuggingFaceEmbeddings

MODEL_DIM = 384
MODEL_DISTANCE_CALC = VectorDistanceMetric.COSINE
embedder = HuggingFaceEmbeddings(model_name="all-MiniLM-L6-v2")
```
```output

  from .autonotebook import tqdm as notebook_tqdm
```
## Create an Aerospike Index and Embed Documents

Before we add documents, we need to create an index in the Aerospike Database. In the example below, we use some convenience code that checks to see if the expected index already exists.


```python
from aerospike_vector_search import Client, HostPort
from aerospike_vector_search.types import VectorDistanceMetric
from langchain_aerospike.vectorstores import Aerospike

# Here we are using the AVS host and port you configured earlier
seed = HostPort(host=AVS_HOST, port=AVS_PORT)

# The namespace of where to place our vectors. This should match the vector configured in your docstore.conf file.
NAMESPACE = "test"

# The name of our new index.
INDEX_NAME = "quote-miniLM-L6-v2"

# AVS needs to know which metadata key contains our vector when creating the index and inserting documents.
VECTOR_KEY = "vector"

client = Client(seeds=seed)
index_exists = False

# Check if the index already exists. If not, create it
for index in client.index_list():
    if index["id"]["namespace"] == NAMESPACE and index["id"]["name"] == INDEX_NAME:
        index_exists = True
        print(f"{INDEX_NAME} already exists. Skipping creation")
        break

if not index_exists:
    print(f"{INDEX_NAME} does not exist. Creating index")
    client.index_create(
        namespace=NAMESPACE,
        name=INDEX_NAME,
        vector_field=VECTOR_KEY,
        vector_distance_metric=MODEL_DISTANCE_CALC,
        dimensions=MODEL_DIM,
        index_labels={
            "model": "miniLM-L6-v2",
            "date": "05/04/2024",
            "dim": str(MODEL_DIM),
            "distance": "cosine",
        },
    )

docstore = Aerospike.from_documents(
    documents,
    embedder,
    client=client,
    namespace=NAMESPACE,
    vector_key=VECTOR_KEY,
    index_name=INDEX_NAME,
    distance_strategy=MODEL_DISTANCE_CALC,
)
```
```output
quote-miniLM-L6-v2 does not exist. Creating index
```
## Search the Documents
Now that we have embedded our vectors, we can use vector search on our quotes.


```python
query = "A quote about the beauty of the cosmos"
docs = docstore.similarity_search(
    query, k=5, index_name=INDEX_NAME, metadata_keys=["_id", "author"]
)


def print_documents(docs):
    for i, doc in enumerate(docs):
        print("~~~~ Document", i, "~~~~")
        print("auto-generated id:", doc.metadata["_id"])
        print("author: ", doc.metadata["author"])
        print(doc.page_content)
        print("~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n")


print_documents(docs)
```
```output

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
```
## Embedding Additional Quotes as Text

We can use `add_texts` to add additional quotes.


```python
docstore = Aerospike(
    client,
    embedder,
    NAMESPACE,
    index_name=INDEX_NAME,
    vector_key=VECTOR_KEY,
    distance_strategy=MODEL_DISTANCE_CALC,
)

ids = docstore.add_texts(
    [
        "quote: Rebellions are built on hope.",
        "quote: Logic is the beginning of wisdom, not the end.",
        "quote: If wishes were fishes, we’d all cast nets.",
    ],
    metadatas=[
        {"author": "Jyn Erso, Rogue One"},
        {"author": "Spock, Star Trek"},
        {"author": "Frank Herbert, Dune"},
    ],
)

print("New IDs")
print(ids)
```
```output
New IDs
['adf8064e-9c0e-46e2-b193-169c36432f4c', 'cf65b5ed-a0f4-491a-86ad-dcacc23c2815', '2ef52efd-d9b7-4077-bc14-defdf0b7dd2f']
```
## Search Documents Using Max Marginal Relevance Search

We can use max marginal relevance search to find vectors that are similar to our query but dissimilar to each other. In this example, we create a retriever object using `as_retriever`, but this could be done just as easily by calling `docstore.max_marginal_relevance_search` directly. The `lambda_mult` search argument determines the diversity of our query response. 0 corresponds to maximum diversity and 1 to minimum diversity.


```python
query = "A quote about our favorite four-legged pets"
retriever = docstore.as_retriever(
    search_type="mmr", search_kwargs={"fetch_k": 20, "lambda_mult": 0.7}
)
matched_docs = retriever.invoke(query)

print_documents(matched_docs)
```
```output
~~~~ Document 0 ~~~~

To hell with that," he said, "shake the tree and knock the great sloth down on his ass.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
```
## Search Documents with a Relevance Threshold

Another useful feature is a similarity search with a relevance threshold. Generally, we only want results that are most similar to our query but also within some range of proximity. A relevance of 1 is most similar and a relevance of 0 is most dissimilar.


```python
query = "A quote about stormy weather"
retriever = docstore.as_retriever(
    search_type="similarity_score_threshold",
    search_kwargs={
        "score_threshold": 0.4
    },  # A greater value returns items with more relevance
)
matched_docs = retriever.invoke(query)

print_documents(matched_docs)
```
```output
~~~~ Document 0 ~~~~
auto-generated id: 6d9e67a6-0427-41e6-9e24-050518120d74

```
## Clean up

We need to make sure we close our client to release resources and clean up threads.


```python
client.close()
```

## Ready. Set. Search!

Now that you are up to speed with Aerospike Vector Search's LangChain integration, you have the power of the Aerospike Database and the LangChain ecosystem at your finger tips. Happy building!
