[Permit.io](https://permit.io/) offers fine-grained access control and policy
enforcement. With LangChain, you can integrate Permit checks to ensure only authorized
users can access or retrieve data in your LLM applications.

## Installation and Setup

<CodeGroup>
```bash pip
pip install langchain-permit
pip install permit
```

```bash uv
uv add langchain-permit
uv add permit
```
</CodeGroup>

Set environment variables for your Permit PDP and credentials:

```python
export PERMIT_API_KEY="your_permit_api_key"
export PERMIT_PDP_URL="http://localhost:7766"   # or your real PDP endpoint
```

Make sure your PDP is running and configured. See
[Permit Docs](https://docs.permit.io/sdk/python/quickstart-python/#2-setup-your-pdp-policy-decision-point-container)
for policy setup.
