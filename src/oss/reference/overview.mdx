- [Functional API](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/reference/func/): Functional programming interface for graphs.
- [Pregel](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/reference/pregel/): Pregel-inspired computation model.
- [Checkpointers](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/reference/checkpoints/): Saving and restoring graph state.
- [Storage](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/reference/store/): Storage backends and options.
- [Caching](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/reference/cache/): Caching mechanisms for performance.
- [Types](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/reference/types/): Type definitions for graph components.
- [Config](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/reference/config/): Configuration options.
