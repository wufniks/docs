Trusted by companies shaping the future of agents – including Klarna, Replit, Elastic, and more – LangGraph is a low-level orchestration framework for building, managing, and deploying long-running, stateful agents.

Install LangGraph:

:::python
```python
pip install -U langgraph
```
:::

:::js
```js
npm install @langchain/langgraph @langchain/core
```
:::

Then, create an agent [using prebuilt components](/oss/prebuilts):

:::python
```python
# pip install -qU "langchain[anthropic]" to call the model

from langgraph.prebuilt import create_react_agent

def get_weather(city: str) -> str:
    """Get weather for a given city."""
    return f"It's always sunny in {city}!"

agent = create_react_agent(
    model="anthropic:claude-3-7-sonnet-latest",
    tools=[get_weather],
    prompt="You are a helpful assistant"
)

# Run the agent
agent.invoke(
    {"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "what is the weather in sf"}]}
)
```
:::

:::js
```js
// npm install @langchain/anthropic to call the model

import { createReactAgent } from "@langchain/langgraph/prebuilt";
import { initChatModel } from "langchain/chat_models/universal";
import { tool } from "@langchain/core/tools";
import { z } from "zod";

const getWeather = tool( 
  async (input: { city: string }) => {
    return `It's always sunny in ${input.city}!`;
  },
  {
    name: "getWeather",
    schema: z.object({
      city: z.string().describe("The city to get the weather for"),
    }),
    description: "Get weather for a given city.",
  }
);

const llm = await initChatModel("anthropic:claude-3-7-sonnet-latest"); 
const agent = createReactAgent({
  llm,
  tools: [getWeather], 
  prompt: "You are a helpful assistant", 
});

// Run the agent
await agent.invoke({
  messages: [{ role: "user", content: "what is the weather in sf" }],
});

```

## Core benefits

LangGraph provides low-level supporting infrastructure for *any* long-running, stateful workflow or agent. LangGraph does not abstract prompts or architecture, and provides the following central benefits:

* [Durable execution](/oss/durable-execution): Build agents that persist through failures and can run for extended periods, automatically resuming from exactly where they left off.
* [Human-in-the-loop](/oss/human-in-the-loop): Seamlessly incorporate human oversight by inspecting and modifying agent state at any point during execution.
* [Comprehensive memory](/oss/memory): Create truly stateful agents with both short-term working memory for ongoing reasoning and long-term persistent memory across sessions.
* [Debugging with LangSmith](http://www.langchain.com/langsmith): Gain deep visibility into complex agent behavior with visualization tools that trace execution paths, capture state transitions, and provide detailed runtime metrics.
* [Production-ready deployment](/langgraph-platform/deployment-options): Deploy sophisticated agent systems confidently with scalable infrastructure designed to handle the unique challenges of stateful, long-running workflows.

## LangGraph’s ecosystem

While LangGraph can be used standalone, it also integrates seamlessly with any LangChain product, giving developers a full suite of tools for building agents. To improve your LLM application development, pair LangGraph with:

* [LangSmith](http://www.langchain.com/langsmith) — Helpful for agent evals and observability. Debug poor-performing LLM app runs, evaluate agent trajectories, gain visibility in production, and improve performance over time.
* [LangGraph Platform](/langgraph-platform) — Deploy and scale agents effortlessly with a purpose-built deployment platform for long running, stateful workflows. Discover, reuse, configure, and share agents across teams — and iterate quickly with visual prototyping in [LangGraph Studio](/langgraph-platform/langgraph-studio).
* [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/introduction/) – Provides integrations and composable components to streamline LLM application development.
