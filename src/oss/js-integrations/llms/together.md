<Warning>
**You are currently on a page documenting the use of Together AI models as [text completion models](/oss/concepts/text_llms). Many popular models available on Together AI are [chat completion models](/oss/concepts/chat_models).**


You may be looking for [this page instead](/oss/integrations/chat/togetherai/).
</Warning>

[Together AI](https://www.together.ai/) offers an API to query [50+ leading open-source models](https://docs.together.ai/docs/inference-models) in a couple lines of code.

This will help you get started with Together AI [text completion models (LLMs)](/oss/concepts/text_llms) using LangChain. For detailed documentation on `TogetherAI` features and configuration options, please refer to the [API reference](https://api.js.langchain.com/classes/langchain_community_llms_togetherai.TogetherAI.html).

## Overview
### Integration details

| Class | Package | Local | Serializable | [PY support](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/llms/together/) | Package downloads | Package latest |
| :--- | :--- | :---: | :---: |  :---: | :---: | :---: |
| [`TogetherAI`](https://api.js.langchain.com/classes/langchain_community_llms_togetherai.TogetherAI.html) | [`@langchain/community`](https://npmjs.com/@langchain/community) | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ![NPM - Downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/@langchain/community?style=flat-square&label=%20&) | ![NPM - Version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@langchain/community?style=flat-square&label=%20&) |

## Setup

To access `ChatTogetherAI` models you'll need to create a Together account, get an API key [here](https://api.together.xyz/), and install the `@langchain/community` integration package.

### Credentials

Head to [api.together.ai](https://api.together.ai/) to sign up to TogetherAI and generate an API key. Once you've done this set the `TOGETHER_AI_API_KEY` environment variable:

```bash
export TOGETHER_AI_API_KEY="your-api-key"
```

If you want to get automated tracing of your model calls you can also set your [LangSmith](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/) API key by uncommenting below:

```bash
# export LANGSMITH_TRACING="true"
# export LANGSMITH_API_KEY="your-api-key"
```

### Installation

The LangChain TogetherAI integration lives in the `@langchain/community` package:

```{=mdx}
import IntegrationInstallTooltip from "@mdx_components/integration_install_tooltip.mdx";
<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

<Npm2Yarn>
  @langchain/community @langchain/core
</Npm2Yarn>

```
## Instantiation

Now we can instantiate our model object and generate chat completions:


```typescript
import { TogetherAI } from "@langchain/community/llms/togetherai";

const llm = new TogetherAI({
  model: "meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-Turbo",
  maxTokens: 256,
});
```
## Invocation


```typescript
const inputText = "Together is an AI company that "

const completion = await llm.invoke(inputText)
completion
```

## Chaining

We can [chain](/oss/how-to/sequence/) our completion model with a prompt template like so:


```typescript
import { PromptTemplate } from "@langchain/core/prompts"

const prompt = PromptTemplate.fromTemplate("How to say {input} in {output_language}:\n")

const chain = prompt.pipe(llm);
await chain.invoke(
  {
    output_language: "German",
    input: "I love programming.",
  }
)
```
```output
