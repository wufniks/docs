Using this toolkit, you can integrate Connery Actions into your LangChain agent.

<Note>
**If you want to use only one particular Connery Action in your agent,**

check out the [Connery Action Tool](/oss/integrations/tools/connery) documentation.

## What is Connery?

Connery is an open-source plugin infrastructure for AI.

With Connery, you can easily create a custom plugin with a set of actions and seamlessly integrate them into your LangChain agent.
Connery will take care of critical aspects such as runtime, authorization, secret management, access management, audit logs, and other vital features.

Furthermore, Connery, supported by our community, provides a diverse collection of ready-to-use open-source plugins for added convenience.

## Prerequisites

To use Connery Actions in your LangChain agent, you need to do some preparation:

1. Set up the Connery runner using the [Quickstart](https://docs.connery.io/docs/runner/quick-start/) guide.
2. Install all the plugins with the actions you want to use in your agent.
3. Set environment variables `CONNERY_RUNNER_URL` and `CONNERY_RUNNER_API_KEY` so the toolkit can communicate with the Connery Runner.

### Usage

In the example below, we create an agent that uses two Connery Actions to summarize a public webpage and send the summary by email:

1. **Summarize public webpage** action from the Summarization plugin.
2. **Send email** action from the [Gmail](https://github.com/connery-io/gmail) plugin.

Connery Action is a structured tool, so you can only use it in the agents supporting structured tools.
