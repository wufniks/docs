title: AirtableLoader
---

The `AirtableLoader` class provides functionality to load documents from Airtable tables. It supports two main methods:

1. `load()`: Retrieves all records at once, ideal for small to moderate datasets.
2. `loadLazy()`: Fetches records one by one, which is more memory-efficient for large datasets.

## Prerequisites

Ensure that your Airtable API token is available as an environment variable:

```typescript
process.env.AIRTABLE_API_TOKEN = "YOUR_AIRTABLE_API_TOKEN";
```

## Usage

import AirtableLoader from "/snippets/javascript-integrations/examples/document_loaders/airtable_load.mdx";

<AirtableLoader />
