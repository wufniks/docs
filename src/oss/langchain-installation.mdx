To install the core LangChain package

:::python
```bash
pip install -U langchain
```
:::

:::js
```bash
npm install langchain
```
:::

LangChain does not bundle inside of the the specific LLM (or other) integration packages.
This is done on purpose to avoid package bloat.
In order to access different providers, you will need install them one by one.
See the LLM integrations page for instructions on how to do that.
