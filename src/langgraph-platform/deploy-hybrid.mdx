Before deploying, review the [conceptual guide for the Hybrid](/langgraph-platform/hybrid) deployment option.

<Info>
  **Important**
  The Hybrid deployment option requires an [Enterprise](/langgraph-platform/plans) plan.
</Info>

## Prerequisites

1. Use the [LangGraph CLI](/langgraph-platform/langgraph-cli) to [test your application locally](/langgraph-platform/local-server).
2. Use the [LangGraph CLI](/langgraph-platform/langgraph-cli) to build a Docker image (i.e. `langgraph build`) and push it to a registry your Kubernetes cluster or Amazon ECS cluster has access to.

## Kubernetes

### Prerequisites

1. `KEDA` is installed on your cluster.
    ```bash
      helm repo add kedacore https://kedacore.github.io/charts
      helm install keda kedacore/keda --namespace keda --create-namespace
    ```
2. A valid `Ingress` controller is installed on your cluster.
3. You have slack space in your cluster for multiple deployments. `Cluster-Autoscaler` is recommended to automatically provision new nodes.
4. You will need to enable egress to two control plane URLs. The listener polls these endpoints for deployments:
    - https://api.host.langchain.com
    - https://api.smith.langchain.com

### Setup

1. Provide your LangSmith organization ID to us. Your LangSmith organization will be configured to deploy the data plane in your cloud.
2. Create a listener from the LangSmith UI. The `Listener` data model is configured for the actual ["listener" application](/langgraph-platform/data-plane#”listener”-application).
    1. In the left-hand navigation, select `LangGraph Platform` > `Listeners`.
    2. In the top-right of the page, select `+ Create Listener`.
    3. Enter a unique `Compute ID` for the listener. The `Compute ID` is a user-defined identifier that should be unique across all listeners in the current LangSmith workspace. The `Compute ID` is displayed to end users when they are creating a new deployment. Ensure that the `Compute ID` provides context to the end user about where their LangGraph Server deployments will be deployed to. For example, a `Compute ID` can be set to `k8s-cluster-name-dev-01`. In this example, the name of the Kubernetes cluster is `k8s-cluster-name`, `dev` denotes that the cluster is reserved for "development" workloads, and `01` is a numerical suffix to reduce naming collisions.
    4. Enter one or more Kubernetes namespaces. Later, the "listener" application will be configured to deploy to each of these namespaces.
    5. In the top-right on the page, select `Submit`.
    6. After the listener is created, copy the listener ID. You will use it later when installing the actual "listener" application.
3. A [Helm chart](https://github.com/langchain-ai/helm/tree/main/charts/langgraph-dataplane) is provided to install the necesssary components in your Kubernetes cluster.
    - `langgraph-listener`: This is a service that listens to LangChain's [control plane](/langgraph-platform/control-plane) for changes to your deployments and creates/updates downstream CRDs. This is the ["listener" application](/langgraph-platform/data-plane#”listener”-application).
    - `LangGraphPlatform CRD`: A CRD for LangGraph Platform deployments. This contains the spec for managing an instance of a LangGraph Platform deployment.
    - `langgraph-platform-operator`: This operator handles changes to your LangGraph Platform CRDs.
4. Configure your `langgraph-dataplane-values.yaml` file.
    ```bash
      config:
        langsmithApiKey: "" # API Key of your Workspace
        langsmithWorkspaceId: "" # Workspace ID
        hostBackendUrl: "https://api.host.langchain.com" # Only override this if on EU
        smithBackendUrl: "https://api.smith.langchain.com" # Only override this if on EU
        langgraphListenerId: "" # Listener ID from Step 2-6
        watchNamespaces: "" # comma-separated list of Kubernetes namespaces that the listener and operator will deploy to
        enableLGPDeploymentHealthCheck: true # enable/disable health check step for deployments

      ingress:
        hostname: "" # specify a hostname that will be configured for all deployments

      operator:
        enabled: true # set this to `false` if the operator is already deployed in the current Kubernetes namespace
        createCRDs: true # set this to `false` if the CRD has been previously installed in the current Kubernetes cluster
    ```
    - `config.langsmithApiKey`: The `langgraph-listener` deployment authenticates with LangChain's LangGraph control plane API with the `langsmithApiKey`.
    - `config.langsmithWorkspaceId`: The `langgraph-listener` deployment is coupled to LangGraph Server deployments in the LangSmith workspace. In other words, the `langgraph-listener` deployment can only manage LangGraph Server deployments in the specified LangSmith workspace ID.
    - `config.langgraphListenerId`: In addition to being coupled with a LangSmith workspace, the `langgraph-listener` deployment is also coupled to a listener. When a new LangGraph Server deployment is created, it is automatically coupled to a `langgraphListenerId`. Specifying `langgraphListenerId` ensures that the `langgraph-listener` deployment can only manage LangGraph Server deployments that are coupled to `langgraphListenerId`.
    - `config.watchNamespaces`: A comma-separated list of Kubernetes namespaces that the `langgraph-listener` deployment will deploy to. This list should match the list of namespaces specified in step 2-4.
    - `config.enableLGPDeploymentHealthCheck`: To disable the LangGraph Server health check, set this to `false`.
    - `ingress.hostname`: As part of the deployment workflow, the `langgraph-listener` deployment attempts to call the LangGraph Server health check endpoint (`GET /ok`) to verify that the application has started up correctly. A typical setup involves creating a shared DNS record or domain for LangGraph Server deployments. This is not managed by LangGraph Platform. Once created, set `ingress.hostname` to the domain, which will be used to complete the health check.
    - `operator.enabled`: There can only be 1 instance of the `langgraph-platform-operator` deployed in a Kubernetes namespace. Set this to `false` if there is already an instance of `langgraph-platform-operator` deployed in the current Kubernetes namespace.
    - `operator.createCRDs`: Set this value to `false` if the Kubernetes cluster already has the `LangGraphPlatform CRD` installed. During installation, an error will occur if the CRD is already installed. This situation may occur if multiple listeners are deployed on the same Kubernetes cluster.
5. Deploy `langgraph-dataplane` Helm chart.
    ```bash
      helm repo add langchain https://github.com/langchain-ai/helm
      helm repo update
      helm upgrade -i langgraph-dataplane langchain/langgraph-dataplane --values langgraph-dataplane-values.yaml --wait --debug
    ```
6. If successful, you will see three services start up in your namespace.
    ```bash
      NAME                                            READY   STATUS              RESTARTS   AGE
      langgraph-dataplane-listener-6dd4749445-zjmr4   0/1     ContainerCreating   0          26s
      langgraph-dataplane-operator-6b88879f9b-t76gk   1/1     Running             0          26s
      langgraph-dataplane-redis-0                     1/1     Running             0          25s
    ```
7. Create a deployment from the [control plane UI](/langgraph-platform/control-plane#control-plane-ui).
    1. Select the desired listener from the list of `Compute IDs` in the dropdown menu.
    2. Select the Kubernetes namespace to deploy to.
    3. Fill out all other required fields and select `Submit` in the top-right of the panel.
    4. The deployment will be deployed on the Kubernetes cluster where the listener is deployed and in the Kubernetes namespace specified in step 7-2.
