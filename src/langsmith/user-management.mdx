This page covers user management features in LangSmith, including access control, authentication, and automated user provisioning:

- [Set up access control](#user-management): Configure role-based access control (RBAC) to manage user permissions within workspaces, including creating custom roles and assigning them to users.
- [SAML SSO (Enterprise plan)](#saml-sso): Set up Single Sign-On authentication for Enterprise customers using SAML 2.0, including configuration for popular identity providers.
- [SCIM User Provisioning (Enterprise plan, Beta)](#scim-user-provisioning-beta): Automate user provisioning and deprovisioning between your identity provider and LangSmith using SCIM.

## Set up access control

<Note>
RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) is a feature that is only available to Enterprise customers. If you are interested in this feature, contact the LangChain sales team at [sales@langchain.dev](mailto:sales@langchain.dev). Other plans default to using the [`Admin` role](/langsmith/administration-overview) for all users.
</Note>

<Check>
You may find it helpful to read the [Administration overview](/langsmith/administration-overview) page before setting up access control.
</Check>

LangSmith relies on RBAC to manage user permissions within a [workspace](/langsmith/administration-overview#workspaces). This allows you to control who can access your LangSmith workspace and what they can do within it. Only users with the `workspace:manage` permission can manage access control settings for a workspace.

### Create a role

By default, LangSmith comes with a set of system roles:

- `Admin`: has full access to all resources within the workspace.
- `Viewer`: has read-only access to all resources within the workspace.
- `Editor`: has full permissions except for workspace management (adding/removing users, changing roles, configuring service keys).

If these do not fit your access model, `Organization Admins` can create custom roles to suit your needs.

To create a role, navigate to the **Roles** tab in the **Members and roles** section of the [Organization settings page](https://smith.langchain.com/settings). Note that new roles that you create will be usable across all workspaces within your organization.

Click on the **Create Role** button to create a new role. A **Create role** form will open.

![Create Role](/langsmith/images/create-role.png)

Assign permissions for the different LangSmith resources that you want to control access to.

### Assign a role to a user

Once you have your roles set up, you can assign them to users. To assign a role to a user, navigate to the `Workspace members` tab in the `Workspaces` section of the [Organization settings page](https://smith.langchain.com/settings)

Each user will have a **Role** dropdown that you can use to assign a role to them.

![Assign Role](/langsmith/images/assign-role.png)

You can also invite new users with a given role.

## Set up SAML SSO for your organization

Single Sign-On (SSO) functionality is **available for Enterprise Cloud** customers to access LangSmith through a single authentication source. This allows administrators to centrally manage team access and keeps information more secure.

LangSmith's SSO configuration is built using the SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) 2.0 standard. SAML 2.0 enables connecting an Identity Provider (IdP) to your organization for an easier, more secure login experience.

SSO services permit a user to use one set of credentials (for example, a name or email address and password) to access multiple applications. The service authenticates the end user only once for all the applications the user has been given rights to and eliminates further prompts when the user switches applications during the same session. The benefits of SSO include:

- Streamlines user management across systems for organization owners.
- Enables organizations to enforce their own security policies (e.g., MFA).
- Removes the need for end users to remember and manage multiple passwords. Simplifies the end-user experience, by allowing sign in at one single access point across multiple applications.

### Prerequisites

<Note>
SAML SSO is available for organizations on the [Enterprise plan](https://www.langchain.com/pricing-langsmith). Please [contact sales](https://www.langchain.com/contact-sales) to learn more.
</Note>

- Your organization must be on an Enterprise plan.
- Your Identity Provider (IdP) must support the SAML 2.0 standard.
- Only [`Organization Admins`](/langsmith/observability-concepts#organization-roles) can configure SAML SSO.

For instructions on using SCIM along with SAML for user provisioning and deprovisioning, refer to the [SCIM setup](#user-management).

### Initial configuration

<Note>
  See IdP-specific instructions [below](#identity-provider-idp-setup)
</Note>

<Note>
The URLs are different for the US and EU. Ensure you select your region from the dropdown in the top right.
</Note>

1. In your IdP: Configure a SAML application with the following details, then copy the metadata URL or XML for step 3.

   1. Single sign-on URL (or ACS URL): [https://auth.langchain.com/auth/v1/sso/saml/acs](https://auth.langchain.com/auth/v1/sso/saml/acs).
   2. Audience URI (or SP Entity ID): [https://auth.langchain.com/auth/v1/sso/saml/metadata](https://auth.langchain.com/auth/v1/sso/saml/metadata)
   3. Name ID format: email address.
   4. Application username: email address.
   5. Required claims: `sub` and `email`.

2. In LangSmith: Go to **Settings** -> **Members and roles** -> **SSO Configuration**. Fill in the required information and submit to activate SSO login:

      1. Fill in either the `SAML metadata URL` or `SAML metadata XML`.
      2. Select the `Default workspace role` and `Default workspaces`. New users logging in via SSO will be added to the specified workspaces with the selected role.

- `Default workspace role` and `Default workspaces` are editable. The updated settings will apply to new users only, not existing users.
- (Coming soon) `SAML metadata URL` and `SAML metadata XML` are editable. This is usually only necessary when cryptographic keys are rotated/expired or the metadata URL has changed but the same IdP is still used.

### Just-in-time (JIT) provisioning

LangSmith supports Just-in-Time provisioning when using SAML SSO. This allows someone signing in via SAML SSO to join the organization and selected workspaces automatically as a member.

<Note>
JIT provisioning only runs for new users, that is, users who do not already have access to the organization with the same email address via a [different login method](/langsmith/authentication-methods#cloud).
</Note>

### Login methods and access

Once you have completed your configuration of SAML SSO for your organization, users will be able to log in via SAML SSO in addition to [other login methods](/langsmith/authentication-methods#cloud), such as username/password and Google Authentication":

- When logged in via SAML SSO, users can only access the corresponding organization with SAML SSO configured.
- Users with SAML SSO as their only login method do not have [personal organizations](/langsmith/administration-overview#organizations).
- When logged in via any other method, users can access the organization with SAML SSO configured along with any other organizations they are a part of.

### Enforce SAML SSO only

To ensure users can only access the organization when logged in using SAML SSO and no other method, check the **Login via SSO only** checkbox and click **Save**. Once this happens, users accessing the organization that are logged-in via a non-SSO login method are required to log back in using SAML SSO. This setting can be switched back to allow all login methods by unselecting the checkbox and clicking **Save**.

<Note>
You must be logged in via SAML SSO in order to update this setting to `Only SAML SSO`. This is to ensure the SAML settings are valid and avoid locking users out of your organization.
</Note>

For troubleshooting, refer to the [SAML SSO FAQs](/langsmith/faq#saml-sso-faqs). If you have issues setting up SAML SSO, reach out to the LangChain support team at [support@langchain.dev](mailto:support@langchain.dev).

### Identity Provider (IdP) Setup

**Step 4: Verify the SSO setup**

Have a user with access sign in via the unique login URL from the `SSO Configuration` page, or have a user select the application from their Okta dashboard.

## Set up SCIM for your organization (beta)

System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) is an open standard that allows for the automation of user provisioning. Using SCIM, you can automatically provision and de-provision users in your LangSmith [organization and workspaces](/langsmith/administration-overview), keeping user access synchronized with your organization's identity provider.

<Note>
SCIM is available for organizations on the [Enterprise plan](https://www.langchain.com/pricing). [Contact sales](https://www.langchain.com/contact-sales) to learn more.

SCIM is available on Helm chart versions 0.10.41 (application version 0.10.108) and later.

While in Beta, SCIM support is API-only (see instructions below).
</Note>

SCIM eliminates the need for manual user management and ensures that user access is always up-to-date with your organization's identity system. This allows for:

- **Automated user management**: Users are automatically added, updated, and removed from LangSmith based on their status in your IdP.
- **Reduced administrative overhead**: No need to manage user access manually across multiple systems.
- **Improved security**: Users who leave your organization are automatically deprovisioned from LangSmith.
- **Consistent access control**: User attributes and group memberships are synchronized between systems.
- **Scaling team access control**: Efficiently manage large teams with many workspaces and custom roles.
- **Role assignment**: Select specific [Organization Roles](/langsmith/observability-concepts#organization-roles) and [Workspace Roles](/langsmith/observability-concepts#workspace-roles) for groups of users.

### Role Precedence

When a user belongs to multiple groups for the same workspace, the following precedence applies:

1. **Organization Admin groups** take highest precedence. Users in these groups will be `Admin` in all workspaces.
2. **Most recently created workspace-specific group** takes precedence over other workspace groups.

<Note>
When a group is deleted or a user is removed from a group, their access is updated according to their remaining group membership, following the precedence rules.

SCIM group membership will override manually assigned roles or roles assigned via Just-in-Time (JIT) provisioning. We recommend disabling JIT provisioning to avoid conflicts.
</Note>

### Group Naming Convention

Group membership maps to LangSmith workspace membership and workspace roles with a specific naming convention:

**Organization Admin Groups**

Format: `<optional_prefix>Organization Admin` or `<optional_prefix>Organization Admins`

Examples:

* `LS:Organization Admins`
* `Groups-Organization Admins`
* `Organization Admin`

** Workspace-Specific Groups**

Format: `<optional_prefix><org_role_name>:<workspace_name>:<workspace_role_name>`

Examples:

* `LS:Organization User:Production:Annotators`
* `Groups-Organization User:Engineering:Developers`
* `Organization User:Marketing:Viewers`

### Email verification

In cloud only, creating a new user with SCIM triggers an email to the user. They must verify their email address by clicking the link in this email. The link expires in 24 hours, and can be resent if needed by removing and re-adding the user via SCIM.

### Prerequisites

- Your organization must be on an Enterprise plan.
- Your Identity Provider (IdP) must support SCIM 2.0.
- Only [`Organization Admins`](/langsmith/observability-concepts#organization-roles) can configure SCIM.
- For cloud customers: [SAML SSO](/langsmith/user-management) must be configured for your organization.
- For self-hosted customers: [OAuth with Client Secret](/langsmith/self-host-sso#with-secret) authentication mode must be enabled.

<Note>
Note the following:

- Support for Okta is not yet released. If you are interested in using Okta with SCIM, please let us know at [support@langchain.dev](mailto:support@langchain.dev).
- Other identity providers have not been tested but may function depending on their SCIM implementation.
</Note>

### Step 1: Configure SAML SSO (Cloud only)

If you're using LangSmith Cloud, ensure [SAML SSO](/langsmith/user-management) is configured for your organization.

LangSmith uses the SAML NameID to identify users. The NameID is a required field in the SAML response and is case-insensitive.

The NameID must:

1. Be unique to each user.
2. Be a persistent value that never changes, such as a randomly generated unique user ID.
3. Match exactly on each sign-in attempt. It should not rely on user input.

The NameID should not be an email address or username because email addresses and usernames are more likely to change over time and can be case-sensitive.

The NameID format must be `Persistent`, unless you are using a field, like email, that requires a different format.

### Step 2: Disable JIT provisioning (Cloud only)

Before enabling SCIM, disable [Just-in-Time (JIT) provisioning](/langsmith/user-management#just-in-time-jit-provisioning) to prevent conflicts between automatic and manual user provisioning. Use the `PATCH /orgs/current/info` [endpoint](https://api.smith.langchain.com/redoc#tag/orgs/operation/update_current_organization_info_api_v1_orgs_current_info_patch):

```bash
curl -X PATCH $LANGCHAIN_ENDPOINT/orgs/current/info \
  -H "X-Api-Key: $LANGCHAIN_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jit_provisioning_enabled": false}'
```

### Step 3: Generate SCIM bearer token

Generate a SCIM Bearer Token for your organization. This token will be used by your IdP to authenticate SCIM API requests. Ensure env vars are set appropriately, for example:

```bash
curl -X POST $LANGCHAIN_ENDPOINT/v1/platform/orgs/current/scim/tokens \
  -H "X-Api-Key: $LANGCHAIN_API_KEY" \
  -H "X-Organization-Id: $LANGCHAIN_ORGANIZATION_ID" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"description": "Your description here"}'
```

Note that the SCIM Bearer Token value is not available outside of the response to this request. These additional endpoints are present:

- `GET /v1/platform/orgs/current/scim/tokens`
- `GET /v1/platform/orgs/current/scim/tokens/{scim_token_id}`
- `PATCH /v1/platform/orgs/current/scim/tokens/{scim_token_id}` (only the `description` field is supported)
- `DELETE /v1/platform/orgs/current/scim/tokens/{scim_token_id}`

### Step 4: Configure your Identity Provider

Follow the IdP-specific instructions to configure SCIM integration.

#### Azure Entra ID

For additional information, see Microsoft's [documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/app-provisioning/user-provisioning).

**Step 1: Configure SCIM in your Enterprise Application**

1. Log in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/#home) with a privileged role (e.g., `Global Administrator`).
2. Navigate to your existing LangSmith Enterprise Application.
3. In the left-side navigation, select **Manage** > **Provisioning**.
4. Click **Get started**.

**Step 2: Configure Admin credentials**

1. Under **Admin Credentials**:

   - **Tenant URL**:

     - US: `https://api.smith.langchain.com/scim/v2`
     - EU: `https://eu.api.smith.langchain.com/scim/v2`
     - Self-hosted: `<langsmith_url>/scim/v2`

   - **Secret Token**: Enter the SCIM Bearer Token generated in Step 3.

2. Click **Test Connection** to verify the configuration.

3. Click **Save**.

**Step 3: Configure Attribute Mappings**

Configure the following attribute mappings under `Mappings`:

**User Attributes**

Set **Target Object Actions** to `Create` and `Update` (start with `Delete` disabled for safety):

| **LangSmith App Attribute**    | **Microsoft Entra ID Attribute**                      | **Matching Precedence** |
| :-----------------------------: | :----------------------------------------------------: | :----------------------: |
| `userName`                     | `userPrincipalName`                                   |                         |
| `active`                       | `Not([IsSoftDeleted])`                                |                         |
| `emails[type eq "work"].value` | `mail`1                                               |                         |
| `name.formatted`               | `displayName` OR `Join(" ", [givenName], [surname])`2 |                         |
| `externalId`                   | `objectId`3                                           | 1                       |

1. User's email address must be present in Entra ID.
2. Use the `Join` expression if your `displayName` does not match the format of `Firstname Lastname`.
3. To avoid inconsistency, this should match the SAML NameID assertion and the `sub` OAuth2.0 claim. For SAML SSO in cloud, the `Unique User Identifier (Name ID)` required claim should be `user.objectID` and the `Name identifier format` should be `persistent`.

**Group Attributes**

Set **Target Object Actions** to `Create` and `Update` only (start with `Delete` disabled for safety):

| **LangSmith App Attribute** | **Microsoft Entra ID Attribute** | **Matching Precedence** |
| :-------------------------: | :-------------------------------: | :----------------------: |
| `displayName`               | `displayname`1                   | 1                       |
| `externalId`                | `objectId`                       |                         |
| `members`                   | `members`                        |                         |

1. Groups must follow the naming convention described in the [Azure Group Naming Convention](#group-naming-convention) section.

**Step 4: Assign Users and Groups**

1. Under **Applications** > **Applications**, select your LangSmith Enterprise Application.
2. Under the **Assignments** tab, click **Assign** then either **Assign to People** or **Assign to Groups**.
3. Make the desired selection(s), then **Assign** and **Done**.

**Step 5: Enable Provisioning**

1. Set **Provisioning Status** to `On` under **Provisioning**.
2. Monitor the initial sync to ensure users and groups are provisioned correctly.
3. Once verified, enable `Delete` actions for both User and Group mappings.
