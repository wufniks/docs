Welcome to the LangSmith Prompt Engineering documentation. The following sections help you create, manage, and optimize your prompts:

- [**Create and update prompts**](/langsmith/create-a-prompt): Create promptsthrough the UI or SDK, configure settings, use tools, include multimodal content, and connect to different model providers.

- [**Manage prompts**](/langsmith/manage-prompts): Organize your prompts with tags, commit changes, trigger webhooks, and share prompts through the public prompt hub.

- [**Prompt hub**](/langsmith/manage-prompts#public-prompt-hub): Access and manage prompt tags and explore the LangChain Hub for community prompts.

- [**Prompt playground**](/langsmith/managing-model-configurations): Test and experiment with prompts using custom endpoints and model configurations.

- **Tutorials**: Follow tutorials to [optimize classifiers](/langsmith/optimize-classifier) and learn advanced prompt engineering techniques.

For terminology definitions and core concepts, refer to the [introduction on prompt engineering](/langsmith/prompt-engineering-concepts).
