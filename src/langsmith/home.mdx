LangSmith is a platform for building production-grade LLM applications. It allows you to closely monitor and evaluate your application, so you can ship quickly and with confidence.

<Tip>
  LangSmith is framework-agnostic — it can be used with or without LangChain's open source frameworks [`langchain`](https://python.langchain.com) and [`langgraph`](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/).

  If you are using either of these, you can enable LangSmith tracing with a single environment variable. For more see the how-to guide for [setting up LangSmith with LangChain](/langsmith/trace-with-langchain) or [setting up LangSmith with LangGraph](/langsmith/trace-with-langgraph).
