Observability is important for any software application, but especially so for LLM applications. LLMs are **non-deterministic** by nature, meaning they can **produce unexpected results**. This makes them trickier than normal to debug.

This is where LangSmith can help! LangSmith gives you **visibility into each step** your application takes when handling a request — helping you **debug faster and gain confidence** in your app. From prototyping to production, LangSmith has you covered with **tracing,  filtering, charting, and alerting** to keep your application reliable at scale.

# Get started

This tutorial will show you how to instrument a simple [RAG](https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/mckinsey-explainers/what-is-retrieval-augmented-generation-rag) application that consists of a retrieval step to fetch data and an LLM call to OpenAI to answer the user question based on the data. 

<Tip>
  If you're building an application with [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/introduction/) or [LangGraph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/), get started by reading the guides for tracing with [LangChain](/langsmith/trace-with-langchain) or tracing with [LangGraph](/langsmith/trace-with-langgraph).
</Tip>

## 1. Install Dependencies

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Python">

```bash
pip install -U langsmith openai
```

</Tab>
  <Tab title="TypeScript">

```bash
yarn add langsmith openai
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

## 2. Create an API key

To create an API key head to the [LangSmith settings page](https://smith.langchain.com/settings). Then click **+ API Key.**

## 3. Set up environment variables

This example uses OpenAI, but you can adapt it to use any LLM provider. 

If you're using Anthropic, use the [Anthropic wrapper](/langsmith/annotate-code#wrap-the-anthropic-client-python-only) to trace your calls. For other providers, use [the traceable wrapper](/langsmith/annotate-code#use-%40traceable-%2F-traceable).

``` bash
export LANGSMITH_TRACING=true
export LANGSMITH_API_KEY="<your-langsmith-api-key>"
export OPENAI_API_KEY="<your-openai-api-key>"
```

## 4. Define your application

We will instrument a simple RAG application for this tutorial, but feel free to use your own code if you'd like - just make sure it has an LLM call!

<Accordion title="Application Code">
  <Tabs>
    <Tab title="Python">

```python
from openai import OpenAI
openai_client = OpenAI()

# This is the retriever we will use in RAG
# This is mocked out, but it could be anything we want
def retriever(query: str):
    results = ["Harrison worked at Kensho"]
    return results

# This is the end-to-end RAG chain.
# It does a retrieval step then calls OpenAI
def rag(question):
    docs = retriever(question)
    system_message = """Answer the users question using only the provided information below:
        {docs}""".format(docs="\n".join(docs))
        
    return openai_client.chat.completions.create(
        messages=[
            {"role": "system", "content": system_message},
            {"role": "user", "content": question},
        ],
        model="gpt-4o-mini",
    )
```

</Tab>
    <Tab title="TypeScript">

```typescript
import { OpenAI } from "openai";

const openAIClient = new OpenAI();

// This is the retriever we will use in RAG
// This is mocked out, but it could be anything we want
async function retriever(query: string) {
  return ["This is a document"];
}

// This is the end-to-end RAG chain.
// It does a retrieval step then calls OpenAI
async function rag(question: string) {
  const docs = await retriever(question);
  
  const systemMessage =
    "Answer the users question using only the provided information below:\n\n" +
    docs.join("\n");
    
  return await openAIClient.chat.completions.create({
    messages: [
      { role: "system", content: systemMessage },
      { role: "user", content: question },
    ],
    model: "gpt-4o-mini",
  });
}
```

</Tab>
  </Tabs>
</Accordion>

## 5. Trace OpenAI calls

The first thing you might want to trace is all your OpenAI calls. LangSmith makes this easy with the [`wrap_openai`](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/reference/python/wrappers/langsmith.wrappers._openai.wrap_openai) (Python) or [`wrapOpenAI`](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/reference/js/functions/wrappers_openai.wrapOpenAI) (TypeScript) wrappers. All you have to do is modify your code to use the wrapped client instead of using the `OpenAI` client directly.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Python">

```python
from openai import OpenAI
from langsmith.wrappers import wrap_openai

openai_client = wrap_openai(OpenAI())

# This is the retriever we will use in RAG
# This is mocked out, but it could be anything we want
def retriever(query: str):
    results = ["Harrison worked at Kensho"]
    return results

# This is the end-to-end RAG chain.
# It does a retrieval step then calls OpenAI
def rag(question):
    docs = retriever(question)
    system_message = """Answer the users question using only the provided information below:
        {docs}""".format(docs="\n".join(docs))
        
    return openai_client.chat.completions.create(
        messages=[
            {"role": "system", "content": system_message},
            {"role": "user", "content": question},
        ],
        model="gpt-4o-mini",
    )
```

</Tab>
  <Tab title="TypeScript">

```typescript
import { OpenAI } from "openai";
import { wrapOpenAI } from "langsmith/wrappers";

const openAIClient = wrapOpenAI(new OpenAI());

// This is the retriever we will use in RAG
// This is mocked out, but it could be anything we want
async function retriever(query: string) {
  return ["This is a document"];
}

// This is the end-to-end RAG chain.
// It does a retrieval step then calls OpenAI
async function rag(question: string) {
  const docs = await retriever(question);
  
  const systemMessage =
    "Answer the users question using only the provided information below:\n\n" +
    docs.join("\n");
    
  return await openAIClient.chat.completions.create({
    messages: [
      { role: "system", content: systemMessage },
      { role: "user", content: question },
    ],
    model: "gpt-4o-mini",
  });
}
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

Now when you call your application as follows:

```
rag("where did harrison work")
```

This will produce a trace of just the OpenAI call in LangSmith's default tracing project. It should look something like [this](https://smith.langchain.com/public/e7b7d256-10fe-4d49-a8d5-36ca8e5af0d2/r).

## 6. Trace entire application

You can also use the `traceable` decorator ([Python](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/reference/python/run_helpers/langsmith.run_helpers.traceable) or [TypeScript](https://langsmith-docs-bdk0fivr6-langchain.vercel.app/reference/js/functions/traceable.traceable)) to trace your entire application instead of just the LLM calls.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Python">

```python
from openai import OpenAI
from langsmith import traceable
from langsmith.wrappers import wrap_openai

openai_client = wrap_openai(OpenAI())

def retriever(query: str):
    results = ["Harrison worked at Kensho"]
    return results

@traceable
def rag(question):
    docs = retriever(question)
    system_message = """Answer the users question using only the provided information below:
        {docs}""".format(docs="\n".join(docs))
        
    return openai_client.chat.completions.create(
        messages=[
            {"role": "system", "content": system_message},
            {"role": "user", "content": question},
        ],
        model="gpt-4o-mini",
    )
```

</Tab>
  <Tab title="TypeScript">

```typescript
import { OpenAI } from "openai";
import { traceable } from "langsmith/traceable";
import { wrapOpenAI } from "langsmith/wrappers";

const openAIClient = wrapOpenAI(new OpenAI());

async function retriever(query: string) {
  return ["This is a document"];
}

const rag = traceable(async function rag(question: string) {
  const docs = await retriever(question);
  
  const systemMessage =
    "Answer the users question using only the provided information below:\n\n" +
    docs.join("\n");
    
  return await openAIClient.chat.completions.create({
    messages: [
      { role: "system", content: systemMessage },
      { role: "user", content: question },
    ],
    model: "gpt-4o-mini",
  });
});
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

Now if you call your application as follows:

```
rag("where did harrison work")
```

This will produce a trace of just the entire pipeline (with the OpenAI call as a child run) - it should look something like [this](https://smith.langchain.com/public/2174f4e9-48ab-4f9e-a8c4-470372d976f1/r)
