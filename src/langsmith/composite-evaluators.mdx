_Composite evaluators_ are a way to combine multiple evaluator scores into a single [score](/langsmith/evaluation-concepts#evaluator-outputs). This is useful when you want to evaluate multiple aspects of your application and combine the results into a single result.

## Create a composite evaluator with the SDK

This guide describes setting up an evaluation that uses multiple evaluators and combines their scores with a custom aggregation function.

### 1. Configure evaluators on a dataset
Start by configuring your evaluators. In this example, the application generates a tweet from a blog introduction and uses three evaluators — summary, tone, and formatting — to assess the output.

If you already have your own dataset with evaluators configured, you can skip this step.

# Import dependencies
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from langsmith import traceable, wrappers
from openai import OpenAI
from langsmith import Client
from pydantic import BaseModel

# Load environment variables from .env file
load_dotenv()

# Access environment variables
openai_api_key = os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY')
langsmith_api_key = os.getenv('LANGSMITH_API_KEY')
langsmith_project = os.getenv('LANGSMITH_PROJECT', 'default')


# Create a dataset. Only need to do this once.

dataset = client.create_dataset(dataset_name="Blog Intros")
client.create_examples(
  dataset_id=dataset.id,
  examples=examples,
)

# Define a target function. In this case, we're using a simple function that generates a tweet from a blog intro.
def generate_tweet(inputs: dict) -> dict:
    instructions = (
      "Given the blog introduction, please generate a catchy yet professional tweet that can be used to promote the blog post on social media. Summarize the key point of the blog post in teh tweet. Use emojis in a tasteful manner."
    )
    messages = [
        {"role": "system", "content": instructions},
        {"role": "user", "content": inputs["blog_intro"]},
    ]
    result = oai_client.responses.create(
        input=messages, model="gpt-5-nano"
    )
    return {"tweet": result.output_text}

# Define evaluators. In this case, we're using three evaluators: summary, formatting, and tone.
def summary(inputs: dict, outputs: dict) -> bool:
    """Judge whether the tweet is a good summary of the blog intro."""
    instructions = "Given the following text and summary, determine if the summary is a good summary of the text."

    class Response(BaseModel):
        summary: bool

    msg = f"Question: {inputs['blog_intro']}\nAnswer: {outputs['tweet']}"
    response = oai_client.responses.parse(
        model="gpt-5-nano",
        input=[{"role": "system", "content": instructions,}, {"role": "user", "content": msg}],
        text_format=Response
    )

    parsed_response = json.loads(response.output_text)
    return parsed_response["summary"]

def formatting(inputs: dict, outputs: dict) -> bool:
    """Judge whether the tweet is formatted for easy human readability."""
    instructions = "Given the following text, determine if it is formatted well so that a human can easily read it. Pay particular attention to spacing and punctuation."

    class Response(BaseModel):
        formatting: bool

    msg = f"{outputs['tweet']}"
    response = oai_client.responses.parse(
        model="gpt-5-nano",

    generate_tweet,
    data=dataset.name,
    evaluators=[summary, tone, formatting],
    experiment_prefix="gpt-5-nano",
)
```

### 2. Create a composite evaluator

Define a composite evaluator that aggregates the individual evaluator scores using your custom function. This example uses a weighted average of the individual evaluator scores.

<Accordion title="Create a composite evaluator.">

```python
from typing import Dict
import math
import pandas as pd

# Set weights for the individual evaluator scores
DEFAULT_WEIGHTS: Dict[str, float] = {
    "feedback.summary": 0.7,
    "feedback.tone": 0.2,
    "feedback.formatting": 0.1,
}
WEIGHTED_KEY = "weighted_summary"

# Pull experiment results
EXPERIMENT_ID = list(client.list_projects(reference_dataset_name=DATASET_NAME, limit=1))[0].id
df = client.get_test_results(project_id=EXPERIMENT_ID)

# Skip rows with any missing metric
required = list(DEFAULT_WEIGHTS.keys())
missing_cols = [c for c in required if c not in df.columns]
if missing_cols:
    raise ValueError(f"Missing columns in DataFrame: {missing_cols}")

# Calculate weighted score. This can be any aggregation function
def row_score(row: pd.Series) -> float:
    if row[required].isna().any():
        return float("nan")
    return float(sum(row[c] * DEFAULT_WEIGHTS[c] for c in required))

df[WEIGHTED_KEY] = df.apply(row_score, axis=1)

# Write feedback back to LangSmith
for _, row in df.iterrows():
    run_id = row["id"]
    score = row[WEIGHTED_KEY]
    if isinstance(score, (int, float)) and not math.isnan(score):
        client.create_feedback(
            run_id=run_id,
            key=WEIGHTED_KEY,
            score=float(score)
        )
```
</Accordion>


## Create aomposite evaluator using the UI

You can create composite evaluators on a [tracing project](/langsmith/observability-concepts#projects) (for [online evaluations](/langsmith/evaluation-concepts#online-evaluation)) or a [dataset](/langsmith/evaluation-concepts#datasets) (for [offline evaluations](/langsmith/evaluation-concepts#offline-evaluation)). With composite evaluators in the UI, you can compute a weighted average or weighted sum of multiple evaluator scores, with configurable weights.

    src="/langsmith/images/create_composite_evaluator-dark.png"
    alt="LangSmith UI showing an LLM call trace called ChatOpenAI with a system and human input followed by an AI Output."
/>
</div>


### 1. Navigate to the tracing project or dataset

To start configuring a composite evaluator, navigate to the **Tracing Projects** or **Dataset & Experiments** tab and select a project or dataset.
- From within a tracing project: **+ New** > **Evaluator** > **Composite score**
- From within a dataset: **+ Evaluator** > **Composite score**

### 2. Configure the composite evaluator

1. Name your evaluator.
2. Select an aggregation method, either **Average** or **Sum**.
    - **Average**: ∑(weight*score) / ∑(weight).
    - **Sum**: ∑(weight*score).
3. Add the feedback keys you want to include in the composite score.
4. Add the weights for the feedback keys. By default, the weights are equal for each feedback key. Adjust the weights to increase or decrease the importance of specific feedback keys in the final score.
5. Click **Create** to save the evaluator.

<Tip> If you need to adjust the weights for the composite scores, they can be updated after the evaluator is created. The resulting scores will be updated for all runs that have the evaluator configured. </Tip>

### 3. View composite evaluator results

Composite scores are attached to a run as **feedback**, similar feedback from a single evaluator. How you can view them depends on where the evaluation was run:

**On a tracing project**:
- Composite scores appear as feedback on runs.
- [Filter for runs](/langsmith/filter-traces-in-application) with a composite score, or where the composite score meets a certain threshold.
- [Create a chart](/langsmith/dashboards#custom-dashboards) to visualize trends in the composite score over time.

**On a dataset**:
- View the composite scores in the experiments tab. You can also filter and sort experiments based on the average composite score of their runs.
- Click into an experiment to view the composite score for each run.

<Note> If any of the constituent evaluators are not configured on the run, the composite score will not be calculated for that run. </Note>
